## üèÜ CTF Competitions
> CTF challenges have become an important and consistent part of my free time. While I also enjoy picking up a good technical book to learn, nothing has driven me forward in the long term as much as solving these practical hacking challenges. In my opinion, these challenges not only help to understand technology better but also to identify your interests, strengths and weaknesses and work on them in a focused way.
